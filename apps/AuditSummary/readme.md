This iDempiere Pack-Out/Pack-In project was created for and by the participants of [ERP Academy](http://erp-academy.chuckboecking.com). It is hard to stop people from entering bad data. The most common solution is "training". This project offers a better solution for situation where the system can know the configuration is not correct. The Audit Summary is a go-live tool to help ensure your system's data and data entry processes remain near-perfect during a sometimes lengthy go-live process. 

The above Pack Out/Pack In does two things:

* Creates a sample audit view - show BPs with the work 'test' in their name. We are pretending this is a bad thing.

* Creates an Audit Summary window to display the view.

To use this project, simply log in as System Administrator and Pack In the above zip file. If you would like to learn more about how to use this project, [watch demonstation and tutorial](http://erp-academy.chuckboecking.com/?page_id=840).

This iDempiere plugin was created using [this tutorial](http://erp-academy.chuckboecking.com/?page_id=676). To learn more about installing, configuring, enhancing, and auditing iDempiere and ADempiere, go to <http://erp-academy.chuckboecking.com>
