These are Report Line Set pack ins for better iDempiere income statement and balance sheet reports. 

To use them: 

1. log in as the GardenAdmin role, 
2. open the Pack In window, 
3. create, attach and process a pack in record for each zip file,
4. update the "Income Statement" and "Balance Sheet" Financial Reports with the chuboe versions and
5. run the reports

Please note the Profit Transfer account is missing from the Balance Sheet => Current Earnings section. You will need to create the account and add it to the Report Line Set.

[There is an end to end example of installing and using these reports (including adding the profit transfer account) here.](http://erp-academy.chuckboecking.com/?page_id=2360) Please note that you must be a member of the [ERP Academy](http://erp-academy.chuckboecking.com/) to view these demonstrations.
