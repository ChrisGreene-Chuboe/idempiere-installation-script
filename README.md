# The purpose of this file is to make installing iDempiere on Linux much easier.

# You can isntall all necessary components on a single server, or you can separate the server and database onto different machines using this script with different parameters.

# The scripts is currently hardcoded to work well on ubuntu 12.04 LTS. I will eventually make the script more graceful; however, it is very important to me to keep the script readable. There is as much value in understanding the script is there is utility in using it.

# To isntall all iDempiere components on a single machine, issue the command:

# ./idempiere_install_script_master_linux.sh -P s1llyw1lly -l  &>output.txt

# Wait about 8 minutes, and iDempiere will magically appear on port 8080 of your server. Review the output.txt to ensure all worked as well.

# Use the -h option to learn more about the parameters.

# Happy learning - Do not hesitate to contact me if I can help you learn iDempiere.
